#### experiment design
To examine the **causal relationship** between the explanatory variable and the response variable.

A treatment is the specific level of explanatory variable given to to experiment unit in the experiment, if multiple explanatory variables are involved, a treatment is then the combination of these specific levels from the explanatory variables.

The experimental unit is the entity to whom the treatment is assigned and against whom the response variable is measured.

In a comparative experiment, the group of units that receive the treatment is called the treatment group and the one that does not receive is called control group. Random assignment creates roughly similar groups by approximately balancing potentially confounding factors among the groups (might be one control and multiple treatment groups)

Placebo effect, unit in the treatment group often respond to any treatment, even in treatment without, in case of pharmaceutical experiments, any therapeutic value, this is known as placebo effect. The blinding in subject would help protect against bias from placebo effect.

Double-blind (subjects, also the physicians or nurses or people that administrate the experiment) will help protect against bias that arise from:
- researcher personal preference towards the treatments/ subjects that might incur other confounding factors
- information leak from researchers to subjects to further induce placebo effect

Even the triple-blind experiment where the people analyzing the data do not know who belongs to treatment or control

Block design is one of the experiment design that draws from stratified sampling

#### random sampling VS random assignment

|   | random sampling  | NOT random sampling  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| random assignment  |  This experiment could determine **causal relationship** in the **population** | This experiment could determine **causal relationship** for the **selected sample** |
| NOT random assignment  | This experiment could detect **correlation** in the **population** but cannot make causal inferences  |  This experiment could only detect **correlation** in the selected sample |
