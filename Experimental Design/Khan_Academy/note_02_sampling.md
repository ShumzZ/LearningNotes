### Sampling
###### video lectures see [Khan Academy]()<br><br>

Random sample
- ***simple random sample***: assign each member a number and use a random number generator of some sort to decide who is selected

- ***cluster sample***: select all the members from some of the groups

- ***stratified sample***: select some members from all of the groups

Non-random sampling
- ***voluntary response***: self-selective sample, eg a researcher gives an open invitation and people decide to opt-in or opt-out of the survey

- ***convenience sample***: is when the researcher chooses the member of the population that are easiest to reach for the sample

Bias
- ***response bias***: when people systematically give wrong answers, eg asks whether people cheat or give critical views on their bosses in person

- ***non-response bias***: people chosen for the sample cannot be contacted or refused to answer, also a systematic bias

- ***under-coverage***: occurs when some members in the population are left out of the sampling frame

Types of statistical studies
- Sample studies: try to estimate a population parameter
- Observational studies: try to discover correlation between two variables
- Experiments: try to establish causal relationship

An example:
The goal of a study is to examine the proportion of 1000 pages that contains an advertisements. The population is 50 issues of a certain magazine, each containing 250 pages.

- examine 50 pages of the most recent 25 issues -- ***convenience sample***
- put all issues in random order and examine every 10 th page until 1000 pages have been examined -- ***systematic sample***
- assign each of the pages a unique number and use a random number generator to select 1000 pages -- ***simple random sample***
- randomly select 4 issues and examine all pages in the issue -- ***cluster random sample***
- examine random 20 pages from all 50 issues -- ***stratified random sample***
